### Implementing a Treap-Based Map Data Structure
This project involves the implementation of a Treap, a randomized balanced binary search tree that maintains both the binary search tree (BST) and heap properties. The primary goal was to create an efficient associative lookup map that supports fast insertions, deletions, and lookups in expected O(log n) time.

# Key Components:
- Treap Construction: Implemented a self-balancing Treap-based map that allows key-value storage, ensuring efficient operations with randomized balancing.
- Operations Implemented:
  - Lookup: Retrieve values in O(log n) time.
  - Insertion: Inserts a key-value pair while maintaining tree balance via rotations.
  - Deletion: Removes a node while preserving treap properties.
  - Split & Join: Enables division and merging of treaps efficiently.

# Skills & Technologies:
- Algorithms & Data Structures: Balanced Trees, Randomization, and Search Optimization.
- Python Programming: Implemented using object-oriented design with generic types.
- Complexity Analysis: Ensured optimal runtime efficiency using expected Î˜(log n) operations.
- Software Testing: Created robust test cases to validate correctness and diagnose issues.

This project demonstrates expertise in algorithmic thinking, efficient data structure design, and performance optimization, which are critical skills for data science applications involving large-scale structured data processing.
